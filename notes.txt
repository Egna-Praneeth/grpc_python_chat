Additional features:
1. Uniqueness in username and Group name
2. Remove username and group names from active list when the user disconnects. 

3. Validation checks for wherever taking user input
4. Give option to user to select username via number and not by typing the number. 

Bugs: 
1. only 1 unread message shown although two are sent. 

Issues: 
    1. Line buffering problem. When listen thread prints. 
        Egna(Me): asdfasdfasfd (have not sent this message but I have received: Ram: Hi Egna)
        Ram: Hi Egnadfasdfasfd is being printed.

    2. Have to clean internal line buffers. Eg. 
        Egna(Me): asdfasdfasfd (have not sent this message but I have received: Ram: Hi Egna)
        Ram: Hi Egnadfasdfasfd is being printed. 
        Then when Egna wants to send Hi, he types : Egna(Me): Hi. But the message sent is:
        asdfasdfasfdHi

        To reproduce this issue:

        import time
        import sys

        time.sleep(3)

        sys.stdout.flush()
        msg = input("Type: ")
        print(msg)

        =================
        When sleeping, you can type something, even this will be printed.
