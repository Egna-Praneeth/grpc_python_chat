Issues: 
1. Line buffering problem. When listen thread prints. 
    Egna(Me): asdfasdfasfd (have not sent this message but I have received: Ram: Hi Egna)
    Ram: Hi Egnadfasdfasfd is being printed. 

Resolved: Overwritting previously printed lines in python

2. Have to clean internal line buffers. Eg. 
    Egna(Me): asdfasdfasfd (have not sent this message but I have received: Ram: Hi Egna)
    Ram: Hi Egnadfasdfasfd is being printed. 
    Then when Egna wants to send Hi, he types : Egna(Me): Hi. But the message sent is:
     asdfasdfasfdHi

    To reproduce this issue:

    import time
    import sys

    time.sleep(3)

    sys.stdout.flush()
    msg = input("Type: ")
    print(msg)

    =================
    When sleeping, you can type something, even this will be printed.
